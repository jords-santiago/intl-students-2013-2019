### Data Sources

For the international students data, this can be acquired from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) online library.  This has an online Education Statistics database gathered from educational institutions.  The dataset specifically acquired from this library is the [Enrolment of international students by origin](https://stats.oecd.org/viewhtml.aspx?datasetcode=EDU_ENRL_MOBILE&lang=en).  This data mainly contains information from 2013 to 2019.  The full dataset in CSV format was downloaded as shown below.

For the World Development Indicators data, this can be found in the World Bank Open Data site.  From its [World Development Indicators DataBank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators#), specified indicators can be queried for a given set of countries across a period of time as shown below.  Since the OECD data covers years 2013 to 2019, the data extract from this databank covers that time period as well.
